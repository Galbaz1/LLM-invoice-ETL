### Packaging Costs

#### Overview
Packaging costs refer to a deposit system for reusable packaging (e.g., bottles, kegs, crates) used to encourage returns and recycling in the Netherlands.

It's refered to as 'statiegeld' and applied to small packaging like cans, bottles. For B-to-B it's refered to as 'emballage' and applied to crates, pallets, beer kegs and such.

#### Key Details

1. **Deposit Charges**:

   - **When Charged**: Added to the invoice when packaging is delivered.
   - **When Refunded**: Credited when the packaging is returned.

2. **Invoice Handling**:
   - **Separate Listing**: Emballage charges are listed separately, labeled as 'statiegeld' or 'emballage'.
   - **Impact on Total**: The sum can be positive (when charged) or negative (when refunded), affecting the total payable amount.
   - **Not a Sales Transaction**: Emballage charges do not qualify as a sale and are not included in VAT calculations.

3. **Tax Treatment**:
   - **VAT**: Emballage charges are not subject to VAT (BTW). They are treated as VAT-exempt. Meaning neither count for 'null_tax_base', 'low_tax_base' or 'high_tax'

#### Example
- **Purchase**: A delivery from Heineken includes crates and kegs with a deposit. The invoice lists the item price and a separate emballage charge.
- **Return**: Returning empty crates/kegs results in a credit note/refund for the emballage amount.
