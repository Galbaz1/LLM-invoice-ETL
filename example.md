  - Message: Luca! Pay Attention! The information in the following message is extracted from your last attempt to process the invoice.
You extracted 'Totaal te betalen (EUR) 236,33' as the amount payable citation.
This is not a direct quote from the document.
The citation must be an exact, direct quote from the document that clearly shows the total amount payable.
If the citation spans multiple lines, include both lines in the citation.
The closest match found was: '236,33'
Make sure to follow the citation instructions.
Try a different approach, for example only extract the amount due (or invoiced) without context.
If that does not work try to extract a citation with more context.
  - Analysis: The error occurred because the extracted citation 'Totaal te betalen (EUR) 236,33' was not an exact match from the document. The correct approach is to extract the exact text from the document that shows the total amount payable, which in this case is '236,33'. Ensure that the citation is a direct quote from the document.
